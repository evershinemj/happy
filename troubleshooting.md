# environment problem
after **updating all files** in the list, successfully troubleshooted the environment problem.
> fairly happy now!

# visual studio support for vim
finally installed a vim extension **VsVim** in visual studio, and it is ==awesome==!

# C-n and C-p doen't work as expected in visual studio
solved this problem with the help of **VsVim**! just configure it to handle these two key bindings.
